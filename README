### How it works - example

1. An item in the store costs 100 US dollars.
2. A customer wants to buy the item and selects to pay with Bitcoin.
3. An invoice is generated and, according to the current exchange rate, the price is 6,000 USD per bitcoin, so the customer has to pay 0.1666 bitcoins.
4. Once the invoice is paid, the merchant gets a notification and is credited 100 usd (no fees from BestRate), or 0.1666 BTC.
